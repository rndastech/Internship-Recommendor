4. Personalized Learning Plan: Based on the identified skill gaps, the platform generates a customized learning plan for each student. This plan outlines the specific skills they need to acquire and suggests relevant online courses, tutorials, and resources.

5. Progress Tracking: Students can track their progress as they work through their learning plans. The platform monitors their completion of courses, projects, and other activities, providing feedback and recommendations along the way.
